## ULMFiT + Siamese Network for Sentence Vectors

This an attempt to add an [InfraSent](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.02364.pdf) type Siamese network on top of the Fast.ai [ULMFiT](http://nlp.fast.ai/classification/2018/05/15/introducting-ulmfit.html) archecture

Please download the [data files](https://github.com/briandw/SiameseULMFiT/archive/1.zip) and unzip them in the root folder before trying the notebooks.
I've included the pretraining notebook for reference, but you can skip to the classify notebook if the pretraining is not of interest.
